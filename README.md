What is Florincoin?
----------------

Florincoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Florincoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. It has a unique feature: transaction comments.
Florincoin Core is the name of open source software enabling the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Florincoin Core software, see [https://florincoin.org](https://florincoin.org).
